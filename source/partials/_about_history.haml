  %p From the traditions of the Bugarrigarra Yawuru language was given to people in Yawuru country; the myths and rituals of the Bugarrigarra locate language within specific places, and Yawuru language is used to tell the stories of Yawuru country.

  %p Yawuru belongs to the Nyulnyulan family of languages, which expands over the Dampier Peninsula and is unique to this region.

  %p Yawuru is only spoken fluently by a small number of people, however many Yawuru and non-Yawuru children and adults alike are learning Yawuru language in schools and at Mabu Yawuru Ngan-ga; the Yawuru language centre.

  %p Yawuru language is being woken up in the community.

  %p Thanks to the hard work and dedication of elders and speakers as well as the recognition of Yawuruâ€™s native title rights and the Yawuru Agreements we now have the resources and infrastructure to support and promote Yawuru language.
